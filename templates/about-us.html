            <h4>"A Mere Zebra Scheduler" was created by the Meerkat Zebras - a group <br> 
            of the four coolest people you will ever have the chance to not meet.</h4>

            <p> The first member of the Meerkat Zebras is Chris (no relation to Chris Hemsworth, Chris Rock, or Chris Brown). Nobody really knows much about Chris, but it is said that he could be the most intelligent human being on this planet. Legend has it that he programmed C++ to take commands in Spanish. Amazing...</p>

            <p>Karla's favorite activities are eating cake until she falls into a sugar coma and not working out. Too bad these things haven't gone so well for her since she conveniently found herself on the rowing team...so now in her free time, she mostly sleeps. And does EECS projects.</p>

            <p>Marissa smells a little funny, but makes up for it with her bubbly personality. Her 10 year plan is to stay a student at Michigan as long as possible, or at least until she figures out what she wants to major in. Right now, she mostly hangs out in froyo shops trying to figure out her life.</p>

        <h3>Jennifer Ozkan</h3>

            <p>Jenn is the bomb dot com. She designs websites in her free time - examples being the famous Google search engine and social media site Facebook. Just kidding, but still pretty cool eh? Jenn is by far the most put together of the Meerkat Zebras, but still finds herself lost on central campus from time to time. Most days, you can find her wandering through the diag looking for the ugli.</p>
