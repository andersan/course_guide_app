### Overall Project Description

The main function of our website will be to allow students to peruse different classes for their course schedule. Once implementing the core requirements, our team will integrate Google Maps onto the website for students to have a visual map that will allow them to track distance and time between class locations. Additionally, we would like to integrate data from ratemyprofessor.com with names and ratings of the professors displayed on the website already inputted in the search. We will also add a backpacking feature as well as improve the user experience.
